Apache has a directive, the ErrorDocument, that you can configure in the httpd.conf file to create custom error pages with PHP so visitors to your site don’t see the old, boring, server-created error pages.

Customizable error responses come in three flavors:
1) plain text 2) local redirects 3) external redirects
