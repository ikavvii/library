Structured programming is a programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by making extensive use of control structures. Here are the main concepts of structured programming:

### 1. *Sequence*
- Code is executed line by line, in order.
- Each statement is performed one after the other.

### 2. *Selection (Decision)*
- The program can choose between different paths using conditional statements.
- Examples: if, else, switch statements.

### 3. *Iteration (Loops)*
- Repeating a block of code multiple times.
- Examples: for, while, do-while loops.

### 4. *Modularity*
- Breaking the program into smaller, reusable functions or procedures.
- Each function has a single, well-defined purpose.

### 5. *Single Entry, Single Exit*
- Every block of code (function, loop, etc.) should have one entry point and one exit point.
- Avoids confusion caused by multiple entry or exit points.

### 6. *Top-Down Design*
- The program is designed from the top level, breaking down into smaller sub-tasks.
- Helps in organizing code logically.

### 7. *Block Structures*
- Code is grouped into blocks (like { } in C/C++/Java, indentation in Python).
- Improves readability and maintainability.

*Benefits of Structured Programming:*
- Easier to read and maintain.
- Reduces errors and debugging time.
- Facilitates teamwork and collaboration.
- Makes code reusable and scalable.

Programming languages have several key characteristics that define how they work and how they are used. Here are the main characteristics:

---

### 1. *Syntax*
- The set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured programs.
- Determines how code must be written.

### 2. *Semantics*
- The meaning of the statements and expressions written in the language.
- What the instructions actually do when executed.

### 3. *Pragmatics*
- How language features are practically used in real-world programming.

### 4. *Abstraction*
- Ability to define complex operations in simple ways (e.g., functions, classes).
- Allows programmers to manage complexity.

### 5. *Portability*
- Code written in the language can run on different types of hardware/operating systems with little or no modification.

### 6. *Efficiency*
- How well the language uses system resources (CPU, memory).
- Affects performance of programs.

### 7. *Expressiveness*
- The ease with which a language can express complex ideas.
- Some languages make certain tasks easier (e.g., Python for scripting, C++ for system programming).

### 8. *Type System*
- How data types are handled.
- Can be static or dynamic, strong or weak.

### 9. *Paradigm Support*
- Which programming paradigms are supported (e.g., procedural, object-oriented, functional).

### 10. *Error Handling*
- Mechanisms for dealing with errors (e.g., exceptions, error codes).

### 11. *Readability*
- How easy it is to read and understand code written in the language.
- Impacts maintainability.

### 12. *Modularity*
- Support for breaking programs into smaller, manageable pieces (e.g., functions, modules, packages).

### 13. *Security*
- Features that help protect programs from malicious actions or unintended errors.
